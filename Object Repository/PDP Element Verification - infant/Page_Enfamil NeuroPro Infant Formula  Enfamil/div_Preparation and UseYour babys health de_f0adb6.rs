      <value>Preparation and UseYour baby’s health depends on carefully following the instructions below.

Proper hygiene, preparation, dilution, use and storage are important when preparing infant formula. Powdered infant formulas are not sterile and should not be fed to premature infants or infants who might have immune problems unless directed and supervised by your baby’s doctor. Ask your baby’s doctor which formula is appropriate for your baby. Ask your baby’s doctor about the need to use cooled, boiled water for mixing and the need to boil clean utensils, bottles and nipples in water before use.




1.

Wash hands thoroughly with soap &amp; water before preparing formula.


2.

Pour desired amount of water into the bottle. Add powder.


3.

Put the cap on the bottle and shake. Feed or store immediately in refrigerator.






	
		
			To Make *
			Water
			Powder
		
		
			2 fl oz bottle
			2 fl oz
			1 unpacked level scoop (8.8 g)
		
		
			4 fl oz bottle
			4 fl oz
			2 unpacked level scoop (17.6 g)
		
		
			8 fl oz bottle
			8 fl oz
			4 unpacked level scoop (35.2 g)
		
	



*Each scoop adds about 0.2 fl oz to the amount of prepared formula.




WARNING: Do not use a microwave oven to warm formula. Serious burns may result.

Failure to follow these instructions could result in severe harm. Once prepared, infant formula can spoil quickly. Either feed immediately or cover and store in refrigerator at 35-40°F (2-4°C) for no longer than 24 hours. Do not use prepared formula if it is unrefrigerated for more than a total of 2 hours. Do not freeze prepared formula. After feeding begins, use formula within one hour or discard.

Storage/Handling: Store powder at room temperature; avoid extreme temperatures. After opening, keep lid tightly closed, store in dry area, and use contents within 1 month. Use tub with Enfamil NeuroPro Infant formula only. Keep powder fresh and prevent bacterial growth by assuring tub is clean and completely dry. Completely empty tub and wipe with a clean, dry cloth before refilling.

If you choose to empty pouch into tub, you must retain the batch code and “use by” date sticker from pouch.
